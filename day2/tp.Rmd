```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## 

```{r}
x <- c(4, 6, 3, 5, 1, 9)

2 - and with a data frame

fr<-data.frame(x = c(4, 6, 3, 5, 1, 9), y = c(8, 11, 5, 10, 3, 17), z = c("a", "a", "b", "a", "b", "a"))

3 - Draw the graph with the line using plot function

4 - Interpret the object, of class "lm", returned by lm and explain his attributes: lin <- lm (y ~ x, fr), fr is the frame above
```
